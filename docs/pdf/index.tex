This is a C++11 library for the \mbox{\hyperlink{classLSM9DS1}{L\+S\+M9\+D\+S1}} on a Raspberry PI using a callback handler for the data. The callback handler is called at the sampling rate of the accelerometer of the \mbox{\hyperlink{classLSM9DS1}{L\+S\+M9\+D\+S1}}.

It\textquotesingle{}s based on the \href{https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_LSM9DS1_Arduino_Library}{\texttt{ Spark\+Fun\+\_\+\+L\+S\+M9\+D\+S1\+\_\+\+Arduino\+\_\+\+Library}}.

Included is also a P\+CB design to connect the I\+MU with a long cable via level shifters to the Raspberry PI.
