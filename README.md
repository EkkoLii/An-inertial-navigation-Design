## About
Inertial navigation is a navigation and positioning system based on the Inertial Measurement Unit to measure the acceleration of the carrier itself and then obtain its velocity and position by integration. It is used in a wide range of aircraft and aerospace applications.

The An-innertial-navigation-Design project is a two-dimensional navigation system developed with a Raspberry Pi and an inertial measurement unit. The project aims to help carriers locate themselves in areas where signals are weak, such as underground garages, unmanned areas, etc. The main compilation language for the development of the project is C++ and the operating system is Linux.
