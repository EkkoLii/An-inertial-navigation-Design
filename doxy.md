# I2C LSM9DS1 RaspberryPI C++ Library

This is a C++11 library for the LSM9DS1 on a Raspberry PI using a callback handler for the data.
The callback handler is called at the sampling rate of the accelerometer of the LSM9DS1.

It's based on the [SparkFun_LSM9DS1_Arduino_Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_LSM9DS1_Arduino_Library).

Included is also a PCB design to connect the IMU with a long cable via level shifters to the Raspberry PI.
